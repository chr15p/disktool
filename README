NAME
       disktool - Display attached devices and their scsi addresses.

SYNOPSIS
       disktool  [-d]  [-h] [-p seperator] [-q] [-s] [-n] [-m]

DESCRIPTION
       When  run  without  options  disktool  displays the address, device node, vendor and model of each scsi device attached to the system. This
       information is gathered by querying hal.


Options
       -d, --clean
              Delete scsi devices that the operating system still believes exist but do not. These are determined by attempting to read a handfull
              of  bytes from the start of the device. If it can be read from its kept, if it cannot be read from (i.e. an error is generated) then
              delete the device from the operating systems table of available devices.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message

       -p, --separator=[seperator]
              Use the supplied string as the column seperator rather then the default variable number of spaces

       -q, --noheaders
              Quiet. Do not print column headers

       -s, --scan
              Rescan to detect newly added devices by issuing a lip command to the fc host device. This does not remove old devices (see -d )

       -n, --device
              Number. Display the major and minor numbers of any devices found.

       -m, --mapper
              Mapper. Display the dm-multipath usage (if any) for this device.
